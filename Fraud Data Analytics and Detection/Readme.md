# Fraud Data Analytics and Detection 🔍
### ☝🏻☝🏻Harnessing Data Analytics to Combat Fraud. 😇😇😇
In the ever-evolving world of finance and insurance, the ability to detect fraud swiftly and accurately is paramount. My Fraud Detection Project is at the forefront of this battle, employing advanced data analytics and machine learning to unearth fraudulent activities and safeguard businesses from financial losses.

📊 Data-Driven Insights:
Our project utilizes a carefully constructed mock dataset that simulates real-world financial transactions. This dataset, featuring over 100,000 records, includes key variables such as Age, Employment Status, Credit Score, Policy Type, and Premium Amount. Through comprehensive data analysis, we identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities.

🤖 Leveraging Machine Learning:
The core of our project lies in the application of robust machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. These models undergo thorough evaluation using techniques like K-Folds cross-validation and are measured against metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. This rigorous approach ensures we accurately pinpoint fraud with high confidence.

💼 Impact on Business:
The implementation of our fraud detection models has the potential to dramatically reduce financial losses due to fraud. In a simulated environment, our models suggest potential savings of up to 276 million THB annually, highlighting the significant impact of data analytics in real-world business scenarios.
